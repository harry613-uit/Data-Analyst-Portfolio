## Project 1 : Movie Rating Analysis using Python
Analyzing the rating given by viewers of a movie helps many people decide whether or not to watch that movie. So, for the Movie Rating Analysis task, you first need to have a dataset that contains data about the ratings given by each viewer. For this task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle that contains two files:

1 One file contains the data about the movie Id, title and the genre of the movie 
2 The other file contains the user id, movie id, ratings given by the user and the timestamp of the ratings
